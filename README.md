# Nails
Team Members: Lana Lam, Alyssa Young, and Mya Curry
Madison Academic Magnet High School

Lana Lam:
My name is Lana Lam and I overlooked the entire process of the website. I helped direct my team members and gave them guidance. I also helped in the back end part. I created the information in the tables, while my other team member, Mya, created the tables. I also helped create the code for a lot of the website. I coded all of the cards. I wrote the various paragraphs on the site. In addition, I created multiple images on the website with computer programs. These images are the ones displaying the nail shape, nail length, and nail color.

Alyssa Young:
My name is Alyssa Young and I created the styling portion of the website. From color schemes to fixed background images, I styled the visuals that you are looking at. The hardest thing to style was smost definitely the fixed background image. However, through multiple videos and descriptions, I learned a code that worked with our website set up in order to add a little extra to our website. I also styled the forms and the inputs for the PHP login forms. 

Mya Curry:
My name is Mya Curry and I added the text and made the chart in PHPmyadmin. When my team member, Alyssa, added the footer I put our store hours, contact information, and the different store fronts that we have. I placed all the information in PHPmyadmin such as the tables for the colors, the shapes, and the finishes.
